Sure! Let's dive into the details for each pattern used for searching in a matrix sorted both row-wise and column-wise:

### 1. **Starting at Top-Right Corner**

**1. Example and Short Explanation**

**Input:**

Matrix:
```
1  4  7
2  5  8
3  6  9
```
Target: `5`

**Output:**

Target found at position `(1, 1)`.

**Explanation:**

- Start at the top-right corner `(0, 2)` with value `7`.
- Since `7` > `5`, move left to `(0, 1)` with value `4`.
- Since `4` < `5`, move down to `(1, 1)` with value `5`.
- The target `5` is found at `(1, 1)`.

**2. Real-Life Applications**

1. **Inventory Systems:** Quickly locate items in a warehouse where items are sorted by category and quantity.
2. **Flight Schedules:** Find flight details from airport displays where flights are sorted by departure time and gate.
3. **Library Catalogs:** Search for books in libraries where they are sorted by author and publication year.
4. **E-commerce Platforms:** Locate products in an online store where items are sorted by price and rating.
5. **Medical Records:** Retrieve patient records in hospitals where records are sorted by admission date and severity.

**3. Benefits of This Algorithm**

- **Efficient:** Runs in O(m + n) time, making it efficient for large matrices.
- **Intuitive:** Easy to understand and implement with a straightforward approach.
- **Minimal Comparisons:** Reduces the number of comparisons needed by leveraging the sorted nature of the matrix.

**4. Limitation of Data Structure**

- **Sorted Matrix Requirement:** Assumes the matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise; otherwise, the algorithm won't work correctly.
- **Fixed Size:** Generally used for matrices with fixed sizes, not dynamic data.

**5. Time Complexity and Optimized C++ Code**

**Time Complexity:** O(m + n)

**Optimized C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool searchMatrixTopRight(int matrix[][3], int m, int n, int target) {
    int row = 0;
    int col = n - 1;
    
    while (row < m && col >= 0) {
        if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
            return true;
        } else if (matrix[row][col] > target) {
            col--;
        } else {
            row++;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

int main() {
    int matrix[3][3] = { {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 9} };
    int target = 5;
    bool found = searchMatrixTopRight(matrix, 3, 3, target);
    cout << (found ? "Target found!" : "Target not found!") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```
Target: `5`

**Output:**

**Explanation:**

- Start at the bottom-left corner `(2, 0)` with value `3`.
- Since `3` < `5`, move right to `(2, 1)` with value `6`.
- Since `6` > `5`, move up to `(1, 1)` with value `5`.
- The target `5` is found at `(1, 1)`.

**2. Real-Life Applications**

1. **Advanced Logistics:** Quickly track items in a warehouse where they are sorted by arrival time and quantity.

    int row = m - 1;
    int col = 0;
    
    while (row >= 0 && col < n) {
        if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
            return true;
        } else if (matrix[row][col] > target) {
            row--;
        } else {
            col++;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
