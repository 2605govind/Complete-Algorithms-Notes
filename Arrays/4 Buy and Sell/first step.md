3. **Cooldown Period**:
   - **Question**: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. Design an algorithm to maximize your profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions: After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
   - **Difficulty**: Medium

4. **Transaction Fee**:
   - **Question**: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day and an integer fee representing a transaction fee. Design an algorithm to maximize your profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
   - **Difficulty**: Medium

5. **Infinite Transactions with Cooldown**:
   - **Question**: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. Design an algorithm to maximize your profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions: After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
   - **Difficulty**: Medium

6. **At Most Two Transactions**:
   - **Question**: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. Design an algorithm to maximize your profit. You may complete at most two transactions. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
   - **Difficulty**: Hard

By following this order, you start with the most straightforward problem and gradually move to more complex ones, each building on the concepts learned in the previous problems.
