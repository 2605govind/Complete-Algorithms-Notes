serach element in rotate sorted array-2 (dublicate allows)

edge case (3 1 2 3 3 3 3) this is a ede case here we can't use unique allows method of rotae sorted array 1


we just srink search space whent this conditino comes (a[start] == a[mid] == a[end])

TC
average case O(log2n) but in worst case it will be nearest of O(n/2) not exactly same.
(3 3 1 3 3 3 3)
